# Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows the user to deploy complex environments with less worries about the configuration.

## Installation

To install Helm follow the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Create your first Helm project

Make sure that Helm is in your system's path and execute:

```console
helm create myapp
```

This will create a bootstrapped starter project that will allow you to get accustomed with Helm and eventually create your own Helm Charts.
